# HW3

Since I finished the homework in ipynb, it is difficult to indicate which line is the answer. So I will indicate the number of cells instead.

## Problem 1

Import and explore the data: cell 2
Rank and visualize the states that take in the most federal funding: cell 3, 4, 26

Which states spend the most federal funding per student? Cell 6, 7. DC, Alaska, Vermont, Lousiana, New Mexico are top five states that spend the most federal funding per student.
